While this works well when using a single ontology, integrating multiple ontologies can be problematic, as they are developed independently, which can lead to incompatibilities. The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) Foundry was created to address this by facilitating the development, harmonization, application and sharing of ontologies, guided by a set of overarching principles. One challenge in reaching these goals was that the OBO principles were not originally encoded in a precise fashion, and interpretation was subjective. Here, we show how we have addressed this by formally encoding the OBO principles as operational rules and implementing a suite of automated validation checks and a dashboard for objectively evaluating each ontology’s compliance with each principle. This entailed a substantial effort to curate metadata across all ontologies and to coordinate with individual stakeholders. We have applied these checks across the full OBO suite of ontologies, revealing areas where individual ontologies require changes to conform to our principles. Our work demonstrates how a sizable, federated community can be organized and evaluated on objective criteria that help improve overall quality and interoperability, which is vital for the sustenance of the OBO project and towards the overall goals of making data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR).</jats:p>\n               <jats:p>Database URL http://obofoundry.org/</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>\n               <jats:p>Despite progress in the development of standards for describing and exchanging scientific information, the lack of easy-to-use standards for mapping between different representations of the same or similar objects in different databases poses a major impediment to data integration and interoperability. Mappings often lack the metadata needed to be correctly interpreted and applied. For example, are two terms equivalent or merely related? Are they narrow or broad matches? Or are they associated in some other way? Such relationships between the mapped terms are often not documented, which leads to incorrect assumptions and makes them hard to use in scenarios that require a high degree of precision (such as diagnostics or risk prediction). Furthermore, the lack of descriptions of how mappings were done makes it hard to combine and reconcile mappings, particularly curated and automated ones. We have developed the Simple Standard for Sharing Ontological Mappings (SSSOM) which addresses these problems by: (i) Introducing a machine-readable and extensible vocabulary to describe metadata that makes imprecision, inaccuracy and incompleteness in mappings explicit. (ii) Defining an easy-to-use simple table-based format that can be integrated into existing data science pipelines without the need to parse or query ontologies, and that integrates seamlessly with Linked Data principles. (iii) Implementing open and community-driven collaborative workflows that are designed to evolve the standard continuously to address changing requirements and mapping practices. (iv) Providing reference tools and software libraries for working with the standard. In this paper, we present the SSSOM standard, describe several use cases in detail and survey some of the existing work on standardizing the exchange of mappings, with the goal of making mappings Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR).

They provide a widely-used means for standardising the annotation of phenotypes and expression in both human-readable and programmatically accessible forms. They are also frequently used to group annotations in biologically meaningful ways. Accurate annotation requires clear textual definitions for terms, ideally accompanied by images. Accurate grouping and fruitful programmatic usage requires high-quality formal definitions that can be used to automate classification and check for errors. The <jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic> anatomy ontology (DAO) consists of over 8000 classes with broad coverage of <jats:italic>Drosophila</jats:italic> anatomy. It has been used extensively for annotation by a range of resources, but until recently it was poorly formalised and had few textual definitions.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We have transformed the DAO into an ontology rich in formal and textual definitions in which the majority of classifications are automated and extensive error checking ensures quality. Here we present an overview of the content of the DAO, the patterns used in its formalisation, and the various uses it has been put to.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>As a result of the work described here, the DAO provides a high-quality, queryable reference for the wild-type anatomy of <jats:italic>Drosophila melanogaster</jats:italic> and a set of terms to annotate data related to that anatomy. Extensive, well referenced textual definitions make it both a reliable and useful reference and ensure accurate use in annotation. Wide use of formal axioms allows a large proportion of classification to be automated and the use of consistency checking to eliminate errors. This increased formalisation has resulted in significant improvements to the completeness and accuracy of classification. The broad use of both formal and informal definitions make further development of the ontology sustainable and scalable. The patterns of formalisation used in the DAO are likely to be useful to developers of other anatomy ontologies.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "Ontology alignment is the task of identifying semantically equivalent entities from two given ontologies. Different ontologies have different representations of the same entity, resulting in a need to de-duplicate entities when merging ontologies. We propose a method for enriching entities in an ontology with external definition and context information, and use this additional information for ontology alignment. We develop a neural architecture capable of encoding the additional information when available, and show that the addition of external data results in an F1-score of 0.69 on the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) largebio SNOMED-NCI subtask, comparable with the entity-level matchers in a SOTA system.",

    "abstract": "Ontology Alignment is an important research problem that finds application in various fields such as data integration, data transfer, data preparation etc. State-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures in Ontology Alignment typically use naive domain-dependent approaches with handcrafted rules and manually assigned values, making them unscalable and inefficient. Deep Learning approaches for ontology alignment use domain-specific architectures that are not only in-extensible to other datasets and domains, but also typically perform worse than rule-based approaches due to various limitations including over-fitting of models, sparsity of datasets etc. In this work, we propose VeeAlign, a Deep Learning based model that uses a dual-attention mechanism to compute the contextualized representation of a concept in order to learn alignments. By doing so, not only does our approach exploit both syntactic and semantic structure of ontologies, it is also, by design, flexible and scalable to different domains with minimal effort. We validate our approach on various datasets from different domains and in multilingual settings, and show its superior performance over SOTA methods.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a new perspective is suggested for unsupervised Ontology Matching (OM) or Ontology Alignment (OA) by treating it as a translation task. Ontologies are represented as graphs, and the translation is performed from a node in the source ontology graph to a path in the target ontology graph. The proposed framework, Truveta Mapper (TM), leverages a multi-task sequence-to-sequence transformer model to perform alignment across multiple ontologies in a zero-shot, unified and end-to-end manner. Multi-tasking enables the model to implicitly learn the relationship between different ontologies via transfer-learning without requiring any explicit cross-ontology manually labeled data. This also enables the formulated framework to outperform existing solutions for both runtime latency and alignment quality. The model is pre-trained and fine-tuned only on publicly available text corpus and inner-ontologies data. The proposed solution outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, Edit-Similarity, LogMap, AML, BERTMap, and the recently presented new OM frameworks in Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI22), offers log-linear complexity, and overall makes the OM task efficient and more straightforward without much post-processing involving mapping extension or mapping repair. We are open sourcing our solution.",

    "abstract": "Highlights Access to open models through the <code>llm</code> package llm provides easy access to LLMs from OpenAI and beyond, including the GPT4All set of open models. You may now specify one of these models by using the <code>-m</code> or <code>--model</code> option with most commands. When calling a model for the first time, <code>llm</code> will download a local copy. Example: <pre><code>ontogpt extract -t mendelian_disease.MendelianDisease -i tests/input/cases/mendelian-disease-cmt2e.txt -m nous-hermes-13b </code></pre> Or extract from PubMed abstracts: <pre><code>ontogpt pubmed-annotate -t drug \"propranolol mode of action\" --model nous-hermes-13b --limit 5 </code></pre> Or generate clinical case report text: <pre><code>ontogpt clinical-notes -d \"patient with chronic muscle pain and hypoplastic toenails\" --sections \"Past Medical History\" -m nous-hermes-13b </code></pre> See the full list of model options with <pre><code>ontogpt list-models </code></pre> Updated dependency requirements OntoGPT should now be compatible with Pydantic versions less than, equal to, or greater than 2.
