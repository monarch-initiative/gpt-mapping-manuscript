## Conclusions

We are in the very early stages of exploring the use of LLM's for semantic mapping problems, but given the performance that even current LLM's already exhibit on complex matching problems, it is likely that this field is going to move fast. One very strong advantage LLMs already exhibit compared to SOTA matching tools is a much more straight forward
