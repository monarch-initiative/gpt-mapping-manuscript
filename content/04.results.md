## Results

### MapperGPT with GPT4 improves on state of the art across all tasks

On all tasks combined, summarized in @tbl:combined-results, MapperGPT with GPT4 has an accuracy of 0.647, which is a considerable
improvement over the SOTA, demonstrating the validity of the approach.

LogMap returns a score rather than a binary answer - we took
the best performing cutoff. The distribution of F1 scores with
different thresholds are show in @fig:logmap-scatter-plot-combined.

### Anatomy Task Results

We assessed methods against an anatomy ontology matching task
containing all vetted mappings between the Fly anatomy ontology (FBbt) and the Zebra fish anatomy ontology (ZFA).

{#tbl:main_results_fbbt_zfa}

In this task, GPT-4 scored highest in both accuracy and precision.

### Disease matching task results

We evaluated methods against a disease ontology matching task, which was to match
all heritable renal diseases from Mondo to all renal diseases from NCIT.

In this task, the previous SOTA achieves slight gain in precision over GPT based methods.
