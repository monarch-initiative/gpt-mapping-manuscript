## Discussion

In all the presented challenges, GPT4 beats all other systems, including the SOTA ontology matching system LogMap.
One potential advantage LLMs already exhibit compared to SOTA matching tools is that its background

### Study limitations

The anatomy task is particularly challenging for traditional methods as the curated mappings
are quite conservative - e.g

Malpighian tubule <-> renal tubule

### Narrative explanations of results

Unlike traditional ontology mapping tools, MapperGPT can provide narrative explanations
of why two concepts are predicted to be related in a certain way.

We did not perform a qualitative evaluation of the explanations

### Limitations of the method

Our best results were achieved using GPT-4. However, at this time, GPT-4 is expensive to run,
so we do recommend its use in cases where simpler lexical methods
should suffice. We are exploring use of open models that can be executed locally.

### Future Work

We are planning to integrate MapperGPT into our Boomer pipeline to make BoomerGPT,
a hybrid neuro-symbolic mapping tool that integrates probabilistic inference, description logic
reasoning, lexical methods, rule-based methods, and LLMs.
